# IPSillyTools

Simple utilities (mainly bash) to work with IPs

This was creates within the EYEFUL project, and the first tool was one to allow a remote machine to remotely write a file in a given server (with known IP), that includes the remote IP. This is a silly non-generic bad approach that want to remotely look like DynDNS (ha!)
